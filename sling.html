      "Complain to the management
      About my lack of self-respect
      Fast forward to when I'll have friends
      And men who don't interject
      Harping over old regrets
      Hating how I let it get to me" -- Managment by Clairo

      It's hard to articulate why this album is so incredible without an example lyric.  On Sling, Clairo often speaks in metaphor and riddles, but the feelings the lyrics evoke are clearer than day.  This album makes the listener leave the music feeling like a new person, having experienced a truly moving song.  Only 24 and Clairo have been compared to writing greats such as Taylor Swift and Bob Dylan and Sling is the perfect album to understand the comparison.

      <h2>In Her Own Words</h2>
      <p class='text'>
        In April of 2022 Clairo sat down with SPIN Magazine to discuss her music, her increased fame, and being a female in the music industry. In the article Clairo discusses her experience working with producer Laura Sisk who helped on Sling. Clairo explains how she has only ever worked with two female producers and how impactful it is to work with a female producer.

        "It was so amazing. I’ve only worked with two female engineers this whole time, and Laura was one of them. It was so wonderful to have another woman in the room. It made me feel understood. It made me feel closer to the work. She’s so clear and concise but also so kind and empathetic. When we were tracking vocals together, Laura would teach me how not to apologize after doing the wrong takes or messing up. She was just very open-minded. It was really comforting." - Clairo
