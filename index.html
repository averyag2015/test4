        "Working again with Aaron Dessner, Swift challenges herself to find new dimensions within the moody atmosphere: fingerpicked ballads, colorful pop music, and her first country songs in years."

        <br>Evermore takes the top spot because it is the perfect album; a perfect mix between heart-felt lyrics and incredible production. It has songs that cut straight to the core and an introspection that cannot be beat.  The lyrics take the listener on a journey of heart-break and self-realization all wrapped up in the best fall sweater.  This album is the perfect way to kick off “Sad Girl Autumn”.<br>

      <br><h2>About Evermore from Wikpedia</h2><br>
      <p class='text'> Evermore (stylized in all lowercase) is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on December 11, 2020, through Republic Records, less than five months after the singer's eighth studio album, Folklore (2020). Evermore was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her Folklore co-producer Aaron Dessner, with whom she had developed a creative chemistry.Swift launched Evermore as a surprise album like Folklore, dubbing them as sister records. She described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods", which is an escapist, cottagecore-inspired, alternative music direction she first conceived with Folklore in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evermore is a record blending alternative rock, indie folk and chamber pop genres, carried by wintry compositions of fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion.

	      <h2>Top Tracks</h2>
	      <p>Check out some of the top tracks from Evermore below. ‘Champagne Problems’ is the story of a woman who leaves her partner after he proposes and has one last wish for him;to find his true match. The song  is as heartbreaking as it is beautiful. ‘Gold Rush’ is the story of true love truly found and will make any listener get up and dance.  In the song, Swift compares the feeling of true love to being flushed by gold cheeks.  ‘Tis the Damn Season’ is the ultimate Christmas banger about love lost and betrayal; a real pick-me-up for the holiday season.

			 <h2>Favorite Lyric</h2>
	     <p class='text'> "Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
	        November flush and your flannel cure
	        This dorm was once a madhouse
	        I made a joke, Well, it's made for me
	        How evergreen, our group of friends
	        Don't think we'll say that word again
	        And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
	        That we once walked through
	        One for the money, two for the show
	        I never was ready, so I watch you go
	        Sometimes you just don't know the answer
	        'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
	        "She would've made such a lovely bride
	        What a shame she's stuck in her head,they said
	        But you'll find the real thing instead
	        She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred" <br>- Champagne Problems<br>
